# Moodle-Remade

This project was created as a web development project for the **SI40** and **WE4A/B**  subjects, focussing on database development, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and diverse frameworks.

## How to setup the project ?

For weight reasons, (doctrine and symfony weighting around 150Mo each), we had to delete our "vendor" folder. It can however be re-built localy with a *composer install* command in a command prompt interface in the project's folder.
